# Pepper

`Pepper` is a python library named after my tortoiseshell cat that uses the [Alpaca Commission Free Trading API](https://alpaca.markets) as the broker and market information stream and [Twilio Communication API](https://twilio.com) as the user SMS alert service. It allows easy login with a remember me function that stores Alpaca and Twilio keys and information locally using Pickle. 

Currently working on crypto trading algorithms and non PDT stock trading algorithms.
