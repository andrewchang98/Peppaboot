# Pepper

`Pepper` is a python library named after my tortoiseshell cat that uses the [Alpaca Commission Free Trading API](https://alpaca.markets) and [Twilio Communication API](https://twilio.com). It allows easy login with a remember me function that stores Alpaca and Twilio keys and information locally using Pickle.
